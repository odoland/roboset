# roboset
This is just a little robot to play set! (WIP)

image process/computer vision with OpenCV, automation and crawling with Selenium, 
number crunching/plotting thx to NumPy, matplotlib, scipy
with a set algorithm 

all parameters, unfortunately, were manually learned by a human through a crap ton of trials, guess and check and error.

future goals:
machine learn the parameters instead of manual
