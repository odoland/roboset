# roboset
This is just a little robot to play set! 

video demo:

image processing/computer vision with OpenCV, 
automation and crawling with Selenium, 
image analysis with NumPy arrays
plotting and data with matplotlib and scipy

My algorithms:
Sobel derivatives & filtered for peaks of 1/3rd (manually decided parameter) + pixel density for  fill / color.
contour/edge detection for shape. pixel + contour for countt and shape estimation
mapping w/ nested to find paired combinations + complementary match for finding set (see comments in the files)

future goals:

SVM for fitting/predicting
