# roboset
This is just a little robot to play set! 

video demo:

image processing/computer vision with OpenCV, 
automation and crawling with Selenium, 
image analysis with NumPy arrays
plotting and data with matplotlib and scipy

My algorithms:
Sobel derivatives & filtered for peaks of 1/3rd (manually decided paramter) + pixel density for  fill / color
contour finding for shape. pixel + contour for ct and shape estimation
paired combinations + hash map for n^2 search, divmod complementary numeric match for finding set

future goals:
machine learn the parameters instead of manually adjusting them
